\f0\b\fs30 \cf0 Urblox - Urban Planning & Visualization Tool
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\

\f0\b Concept
\f1\b0 \
\
We are building an urban planning tool that you can step into. Plan a city/neighborhood from above and then step right into it. Can help plan for the revitalization of forgotten places, improvement of existing spaces, and formation of new ones.\
